Summary
------
Solidus Core provides the essential e-commerce data models upon which the
Solidus system depends.

Core Models
-----------
Solidus implements over 200 [models](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/core/app/models/spree),
and thus a deep inspection of each in this README would be overkill. Instead,
let's take a quick look at the fundamental models upon which all else depend.
Currently, these models remain in the Spree namespace as part of the legacy of
[forking Spree](https://solidus.io/blog/2015/10/28/future-of-spree.html).

## NOTE: Documentation is a work in progress

An offical, more robust implementation of a User class with Devise
integration.

## The Payment Sub-System
* `Spree::Payment` - Manage and process a payment for an order, from a specific
source (e.g. `Spree::CreditCard`) using a specific payment method (e.g
`Solidus::Gateway::Braintree`).
* `Spree::PaymentMethod` - A base class which is used for implementing payment methods.
* `Spree::PaymentMethod::CreditCard` - An implementation of a `Spree::PaymentMethod` for credit card payments.
See https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_gateway/ for officially supported payment method implementations.
* `Spree::CreditCard` - The `source` of a `Spree::Payment` using `Spree::PaymentMethod::CreditCard` as payment method.

## The Inventory Sub-System
* `Spree::ReturnAuthorization` - Models the return of Inventory Units to
a Stock Location for an Order.
* `Spree::StockLocation` - Records the name and addresses from which stock items
are fulfilled in cartons.
* `Spree::InventoryUnit` - Tracks the state of line items' fulfillment.
* `Spree::ShippingRate` - Records the costs of different shipping methods for a
shipment and which method has been selected to deliver the shipment.
* `Spree::ShippingMethod` - Represents a means of having a shipment delivered,
such as FedEx or UPS.

## The Shipments Sub-System
* `Spree::Shipment` - An order's planned shipments including
tracking and cost. Shipments are fulfilled from Stock Locations.
