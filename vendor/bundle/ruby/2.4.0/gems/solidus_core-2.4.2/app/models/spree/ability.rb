# Implementation class for Cancan gem.  Instead of overriding this class, consider adding new permissions
# using the special +register_ability+ method which allows extensions to add their own abilities.

    # modify the default +Ability+ of an application.  The +ability+ argument must be a class that includes
    # the +CanCan::Ability+ module.  The registered ability should behave properly as a stand-alone class
    # and therefore should be easy to test in isolation.
