  called excessively.

* Update backend views to only reference backend routes (#57)

* Devise dependency updates

  The locked versions of Devise and Devise-Encryptable have been updated.
  Devise, in particular, has been bumped to a new major version, which removes
  support for the following:

  - Rails 3.2. and 4.0
  - Ruby 1.9 and 2.0

  These losses are deemed acceptable, as Solidus' core itself does not
  support any of these versions.

  For more details on the changes, see the Devise changelog:
